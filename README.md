Hi, I am Hawra Alali.

I am a Computer Science student with an interest in machine learning and how it can be applied to real-world problems. I enjoy learning new technical skills and exploring how technology can be used in practical and meaningful ways.

I am excited to develop my understanding of Git, GitHub, and machine learning throughout this course.
